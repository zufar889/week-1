compose the code and test the code according to the orders of fellow teachers, then send the results to the gradescope

ensure the program code runs and passes tests on autograder score to get the best score, at the end of the specified submit time get maximum results as expected

Problem Set 1
Log into code.cs50.io using your GitHub account and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your very own “codespace” for Visual Studio Code
Once your codespace has loaded, close any Welcome tabs that might have opened by default
In Codespace’s terminal, complete the steps under SSH at cs50.readthedocs.io/github/#ssh to configure your codespace for some of CS50’s command-line tools
Log into submit.cs50.io using your GitHub account and click Authorize to activate check50.
Run update50 in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click Rebuild now
Submit Hello
Submit one of:
this version of Mario if feeling less comfortable
this version of Mario if feeling more comfortable
Submit one of:
Cash if feeling less comfortable
Credit if feeling more comfortable
If you submit both versions of Mario, we’ll record the higher of your two scores. If you submit both Cash and Credit, we’ll record the higher of your two scores.

Lab1
Say we have a population of n llamas. Each year, n / 3 new llamas are born, and n / 4 llamas pass away.

For example, if we were to start with n = 1200 llamas, then in the first year, 1200 / 3 = 400 new llamas would be born and 1200 / 4 = 300 llamas would pass away. At the end of that year, we would have 1200 + 400 - 300 = 1300 llamas.

To try another example, if we were to start with n = 1000 llamas, at the end of the year, we would have 1000 / 3 = 333.33 new llamas. We can’t have a decimal portion of a llama, though, so we’ll truncate the decimal to get 333 new llamas born. 1000 / 4 = 250 llamas will pass away, so we’ll end up with a total of 1000 + 333 - 250 = 1083 llamas at the end of the year.
